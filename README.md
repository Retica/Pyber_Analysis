# Pyber_Analysis

Analysis of Ride data by City Type

In this analysis we broke down our csv files into a readable format and broke our data down into multiple tables.

We then used those table to collect the data that we needed to do our analysis. Assigned all the necessary variables for our data collection. And finally formatted and merged our data into a single summery table

After we had all the data collected we used the pyplot dependency to create a line graph for the different type of cities to display our findings
